!	SPREADING RING
!------------------------------------------------
double precision function spreading_ring(xin,x,tau)
	! Analytical solution taken from:
	!  ---> Lodato, G. Classical disc physics. New Astronomy Reviews 52, 21â€“41 (2008).
	! The total mass is zero because it is adimensionalized through Sigma(R,t) = Sigma0 * sigma(x,tau) and R=R0*x, t=R0^2/nu*tau
	
	! NOTE: the modified Bessel function I1/4(x) is a function that increases very rapidly.
	! 		for a good computation the arument x should not exceed 300 (I1/4(300)=1.e143 !!)
	!		for these reasons, a working regime is: rin=0.01, rout=2. xin=1. t0=0.001
	
	! Numerical Recipes modules; needed to compute the modified fractional Bessel Function of first kind.
